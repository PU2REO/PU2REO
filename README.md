Hi, I’m @PU2REO, your host! 
Welcome to my GitHub place!

I'm an Electrical Engineer since 1996, and will use this place to store some of my source code and electronic schematics used in my hobbies. Most of them, Ham Radio related.
Feel free to take a look and give an opinion. 

Best of everything,
PU2REO.
